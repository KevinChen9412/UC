The [python directory](python) contains a **python** app I made. The app is produced mainly by utilising the *matplotlib*, *pandas* and *tkinter* packages.

The [R-Data-Wrangling.ipynb](R-Data-Wrangling.ipynb) is one of my previous work in **R**. I scraped the mobile phone sales data from an IT retailer's website, cleaned it and then presented it in various visualisations using ggplot2 package.

Some of my **Tabelau** works can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/kevin6936

The [SKOPE Project report](SKOPE-Project-report.pdf) is the report I wrote for my summer internship  at SKOPE. The code and data are not avaliable anymore due to an NDA agreement with the company.
